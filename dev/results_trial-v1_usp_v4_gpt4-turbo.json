Both the input and the output convey the same essential message: a male individual (\"Il\"/\"He\") no longer possesses something (\"a perdu\"/\"lost\") that he had previously received from his father (\"ce qu'il a re\u00e7u de son p\u00e8re\"/\"what he received from his father\"). The output remains faithful to the information presented in the input and does not introduce any unsupported elements.\n\nThe difference between \"wasted\" in the target and \"lost\" in the output is a matter of nuance. While \"wasted\" implies that he may have been reckless or irresponsible with what he received, \"lost\" is a more neutral term that doesn't necessarily imply how or why he no longer has it.

The English output \"He lost what he received from his father.\" is a reasonable translation of the French input \"Il a perdu ce qu'il a re\u00e7u de son p\u00e8re.\" Both the input and the output convey the idea of the subject losing something that was received from the father. \n\nThe target translation \"He wasted that which he had received from his father.\" carries a slightly different connotation, suggesting not just loss but also misuse or squandering.

There is no additional information in the output that is not supported by the input.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the target translation uses the word \"wasted\" instead of \"lost,\" which adds a nuance of carelessness or mismanagement, rather than just the act of losing something.

The target suggests not just loss, but a sense of squandering or misuse, which is not conveyed by the word \"lost\" in the output.
