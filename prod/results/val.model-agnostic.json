The original sentence indicates that Tom lacks a person to tell his story to.\n\nThe output \"That\u2019s why someone told their story\" is incorrect and changes the meaning of the sentence entirely. It suggests that someone else told their story because of a reason implied by \"that's why,\" which is not present in the input.

It suggests that as a result of something (implied by \"that\u2019s why\"), someone (implied to be different from \"Tom\") told their own story.
