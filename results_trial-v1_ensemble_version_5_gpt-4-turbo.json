Geographical Accuracy: Chiuchow (also known as Chaozhou or Teochew) is indeed a city in the Guangdong province of China, which is part of the Chaoshan region. However, it is not a district of Kowloon. Kowloon is an urban area in Hong Kong, which is geographically separate from the Guangdong province.\n\n2.
